  <h1>Take Me to The Kitchen</h1>

      There are two areas of the restaurant: the dining room and the kitchen. The dining room is where people view the menu, make their order and prepare to experience their meal. They may complain to the waiter if their food is cold. They might fuss if they wait too long for the bill. It’s an enviroment for the consumer mindset.

       The kitchen, on the other hand, is a big mess. Everyone is moving quickly, focusing on their work. It’s more of a, “outta my way!” type of environment. Everyone is jumping in and getting started. Dev Bootcamp is the kitchen.

      Prior to starting phase zero, my impression of DBC was that it seems like an intense, fast-paced environment. In addtion to programming knowledge, DBC  promotes vulnerable and open learning. To put it in simpler terms for my family and other “non-technical’ people, I like to use a construction metaphor.

      “Pretend I’m taking a course to build a house in a very short amount of time,” I say. “Imagine learning all those skills very quickly; skills like how to reading blueprints, designing a sky light or using a nail gun. I'm setting out to acquire all those skills, in a short period of time, and then build my own house. That new house will be my resume."

      My expectations remain the same after seeing the video. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous, because I definitely am. Beyond feeling nervous, I think the strongest emotion is that I know what I’m in for: DBC will be fast-paced. I'll have to be vulnerable and expose my weaknesses, and a lot of my ignorance, to my cohort. Most importantly, it's me to get the work done and acquire the skills I need to build my dream house. I’m ready!
