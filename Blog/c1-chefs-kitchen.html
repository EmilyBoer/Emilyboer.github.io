      There are two areas of the restaurant: the dining room and the kitchen. The dining room is where people view the menu, make their order and prepare to experience their meal. They may complain to the waiter if their food is cold or if they wait too long to receive their bill. It’s a transaction made in a consumer mindset.

       The kitchen, on the other hand, is a big mess. Everyone is running around focused on their own tasks, taking ownership of their work while getting done what they need to. It’s more of a, “outta my way!” type of environment where everyone jumps right in and gets to work. Dev Bootcamp is the kitchen.

      Prior to starting phase zero my impression of DBC is that it’s an intense, fast-paced environment that promotes vulnerable and open learning. To put it in simpler terms for my family and other “non-technical’ people, I find my self using a construction metaphor.

      “Say I’m going to a boot camp to learn how to build a house,” I say. “Imagine learning all kinds of skills like how to design and read blueprints then build a solid foundation and even before that, learn how to use a nail gun. I have to acquire all those skills, in a short period of time, and then build my own house. That new house will be my resume."

      My expectations remain the same after seeing the video. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous, because I definitely am. Beyond feeling nervous, I think the strongest emotion is that I know what I’m in for: I know DBC is going to be fast-paced. I know I’m going to have to be vulnerable and expose my weaknesses, and a lot of my ignorance, to my cohort. Most importantly, I know it’s up to me to get the work done and acquire the skills I need to build my dream house. I’m ready!
