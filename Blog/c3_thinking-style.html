  <h1>Mind Over Programming</h1>

    <h4>Jan 31st, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      DBC Phase-0 moves quick. Real quick. And keeping pace requires you to cram a lot into your brain in a short period of time. No wonder the program encourages us to identify our respective learning styles and understand our mindset. It's important that we accomidate our styles and focus on growth so we can succeed. Here are some techniques I use for both.

    </p>
<h3>Learning Style</h3>
    <p>

      After taking the VARK learing style assessment I discovered that my learning style is a bit of a hodge-podge: multimodal. This comes as no surprise--I've always tackled new information in a subjective way and my learning style varies depending on the type of material. Here are a specifc learning techniques/approached that've helped me in DBC Phase-0.

    </p>
    <p>Checking Multiple Sources</p>
    <p>

      I make sure to carefully read Dev's README and  challenge instructions in addtion to whichever resources they point me to. If I still feel a bit foggy on some of the details, I'll do a quick Google search to seek out the same content presented in different forms- videos, blog posts, aritcles, lessons. That helpes me understand new concepts and/or reinforces my understanding.


    </p>
    <p>Working With Others </p>
      <p>
Once I have a basic understanding of the material, it's helpful for me to talk through it with another person. I've taken advantage of the DBC tutoring, our accountability groups and pairing sessions to ask questions and learn from other people. It's always helpful and I always learn something new, even if it's learn a new keyboard shortcut.

   </p>
    <p>Playing Around With Code</p>
      <p>
Even after I find the right answer to an exercise, I'll still play around with the code and see what happens when I change different elements. I find that's a good way to determine what's vital to the syntax and what absolutely cannot change. It's a good way to feel out sensitively and discover other code fuctions.

    </p>
    <h3> My Mindset</h3>
    <p>
Prior to starting Phase-0, DBC sent us an articles outlining two different mindsets; growth and fixed. A fixed mindsets is the belief that there are some things you simply can't learn and that failure is an indication of those things. A growth mindset is the belief that you can learn new things and failure is a part of that process. It's all about knowing you have the ability to learn and pushing through the content until you get it.

    </p>
    <p>
      Epecially with learning something as new and complicated as code, I definitely struggle with keeping the conviction that I CAN and WILL learn new information. I have a few different techniques that help me keep that mindset.


    </p>
    <p> Breaking Programs Down</p>
    <p>

I'll never through my hands up in the air and give up. I always know that if I'm not understanding something, I can break down the code into smaller pieces. Once I work through each of those pieces I can put them back together to understand the larger program.

    </p>

      <p>Keeping my Confidence</p>
      <p>
I developed an inner dialog that continously tells me that I "totally got this," and "understanding this material is completely within my abilities." if I feel a ping of doubt or anxioety, I simply summon those words and push forward.


    </p>

      <p>Celebrating my Achievements</p>
      <p>
I'm always ooking back to what I didn't know at the beginning of the week and recognizing my development. I see that as evidence that I CAN learn new things and AM learning. I find it's helpful to celebrate how far I've come.
