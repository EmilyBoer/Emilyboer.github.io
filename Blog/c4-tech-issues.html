    <p>
      The tech industry is a hotbad for start-ups, many of which inspire irregular work habits and culture. Startups begin as two or thre person companies, companies that more resemble group projects than anything else. If promising, these can grow really quickly, woth everyone working off-hours in temporary  environments.

    </p>
    <p>
      When these companies hire people in droves to meet demand and then suddenly surge into a larger companies, they are doing so at a repid rate. Along with that, the start-up trend is to create it's own culture that rejects tradional corporate bureaucracy. The combination of the two sometimes results in a company have missing a few vital elements.

    </p>
    <p>

Some start-up professionals have reports that the 'fun' tech culture sometimes becomes harmful to working environments. A lack of structure and informal spaces have resulted in a lack of proper management and defined checks and balances.  Also, the casual nature of these work environments can sometimes lead to inapropriate comments or behavior, which can be damaging to certain employees, namely tech's few, and mighty, minorities.

    </p>
    <p>
      A possible solution for emerging tech companies is in creating their own culture, don't forget to put certain company infrastructure in place so employees feel like they have guidance and management. Also make sure to look after the individal employee and include onboarding training to identify what is and isn't approproate office behavior.
