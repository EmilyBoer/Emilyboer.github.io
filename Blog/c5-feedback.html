  <h1>Peer Programming</h1>
    <h4>Feb 12th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      Communication and programming are closely related. That’s why DBC makes sure we practice both, simultaneously, with pair programming.

      What is pair programming?

    </p>
    <p>

      Pair programing at DBC consists of two people working together to complete a co-programming assignment. Typically, one person will be in a driver role (plugging in the actual code) and the other in a navigation role (instructing on which code to plug). Pairs will usually switch roles during the pairing session so both can experience the driver and navigation roles.

      Students can find a person to pair with by reaching out to others in their cohort and either set up a video chat or meet in person. The pair session usually begins will a little bit of small talk so each person feels comfortable and communicative. Once the session is underway, it can last anywhere from one to three hours. After the sessions each person is required to provide detailed feedback about his or her experience.

      My experience with pairing

   </p>
    <p>
      When I first hear about peer programming, I was intimidated. I was worried about working with another person I’d never met and having to put such newly acquired knowledge into practice. Also, I was a little anxious about receiving feedback.

    </p>
     <p>
      My feelings about pairing changed after I had my first pairing session. After my first few times, I came to love it. It’s a great way to share knowledge and bounce ideas off of another person; two minds are greater than one. It’s also a nice way to become acquainted with other people in my program.

    </p>
     <p>
      After giving/receiving feedback, I saw that most people thought I was friendly and easy to work with, but some people didn’t think they benefited technically from working with me. I wasn’t surprising to read that kind of feedback, nor was I hurt or troubled. Since reading that feedback I’ve made an effort to be more expressive of specific knowledge during my session. I make sure to introduce short cuts and relevant information when I can. I also make sure to be vocal about my ideas throughout the session.

    </p>
     <p>

      Overall, I’d say pair programming has been extremely beneficial. Both learning during the pairing session and receiving feedback have really helped me gain knowledge and tweak my habits.
