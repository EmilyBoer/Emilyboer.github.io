  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

    <h4>Feb 16th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
        Imagine the following: A person of a certain race or gender enters into a group and automatically sees themselves as inferior—less knowledge, poorer skills or lacking certain abilities. Because of this self-selection, which is not founded upon proven facts or actual abilities, the person performs on the lower end of the group. This phenomenon can be summed up as stereotype threat.

      Entering into the DBC environment, I’ve definitely had to check my headspace one or two times. I came into the program with no preexisting information on any of the material—seriously, I had no idea what my command line was—and it was super intimidating to work alongside people with computer science bachelors and others who’d taken CSS or HTML classes.

    </p>
    <p>

      Because almost everyone in the program had more experience than me, I also assumed that the new information came easier for everyone else. I didn’t take the lead as much as I could have and assumed a learning role instead of a teaching role. While pairing, I let other people show me the way they’d solve the program instead of showing the way I’d solve.


    </p>
    <p>
      The way I pushed through my stereotype threat was to gain an awareness of my mindset and make sure to try to remain growth-minded.  With a growth mindset I was able to keep the perspective that the mind was elastic. I’m absolutely capable of learning new things and expanding my knowledge, but it’s completely up to me.  With the conviction that I can and will learn, I can over come the stereotype threat and learn.
