  <h1>Imposter Seeks Community</h1>

    <h4>Feb 26th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      Around a year ago I made the decision to see a life coach. I had a couple friends who had met with life coaches and was inspired by their experiences.  It’s something I’d wanted to invest in for quite some time and I couldn’t wait to receive actionable advice on how to play up my strengths and achieve my goals.

      One of the first things I did with my life coach was sift through a page of 20/30 words and define my values. It was a productive first step—it was important to first solidify my values before identifying my goals—and what I came up with surprised me.

    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out that community is one of my most important values—the sense of belonging to something like a larger project, group of people or association.  In a nutshell I’m the type of person who appreciates a home base and thrives in an environment where I can bounce ideas off of the people around me.

    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one problem: I was working as a freelance writer. Not only did I spend most of my days working solo, I also had no larger team I could collaborate with. It was then I realized I wanted to make a change. At that point in my career, I wanted to make the move back into a team environment.

    </p>
    <p>
      That decision, among others, is what brought me to DBC. Fast forward A year later I’m working with others on a daily bases and connecting with like-minded individuals at networking events.

      When I attended a Girl Develop It Meetup last week I had a conversation with another young woman who was coming up against some of the same struggles I’d faced. She also yearned to work in a communal work environment and she asked me for input on how to make the transition.  I told her to try and seek out peers and mentorship as much as she could to both gain a sense of community and open doors for new professional opportunities.


    </p>
     <p>

      One thing that continues to get in my way when I seek out community is imposter syndrome. I feel like while I desire community and group projects I constantly worry that I’m not wanted or no really qualified to be a part of the group. It’s something I’m trying to work on and I continue to make progress with.
