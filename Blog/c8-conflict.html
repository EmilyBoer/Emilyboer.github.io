    <h1>Navigating Through Conflict </h1>

    <h4>March 5th, 2015</h4>
    <p>1.  Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?

    <p>
      In helping plan my close friend's bachelorette party, I had to coordinate with eight different women’s schedules and budgets. The maid of honor found accommodations for the weekend, which were out of budget for the majority of the wedding party. After a few of the women expressed concern with the budget, I felt compelled to speak with the maid of honor about changing the accommodations.

    </p>
    <p>
      2.  What was the source of the conflict?

    </p>
    <p>
      The source of the conflict was satisfying the needs of a group of people, a group of indivduals with different and very specific needs.

    </p>
    <p>
      3.  What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?

    </p>
    <p>
      I felt frustrated for the maid of honor’s lack of notice for the majority of girls in the group. It was obvious to me that there was a large disparity between her budget and the rest of the group. I was surprised she couldn’t see it.

    </p>
    <p>
      4.  What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
    </p>
    <p>
      I approached her and gently expressed concern for the rest of the girls in the group. Before coming into the conversation I researched several different alternative options for accommodations, some of which had better locations.

    </p>
    <p>
     5.  If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?

   </p>
   <p>
    If I could go back, I would step up earlier on as a leader in the planning process. I’m in a unique position in this group where I know most everyone from college, high school and work while the other girls are less familiar with each other. I could have been more helpful from the get-go and perhaps avoided the whole situation.

  </p>

  <p>
    6.  What did you learn from this experience?

  </p>
  <p>
    This experience reaffirmed one of my convictions—when approaching a sensitive situation make sure to be delicate and compassionate towards everyone’s points of view.
  </p>
