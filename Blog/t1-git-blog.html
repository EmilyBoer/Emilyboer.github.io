    Like how the 'save' function saves work in Micrsoft Word, version control's function record changes to protect work. Version control also allows developers to take detailed snapshots of their projects so they may go back and review their progress.
    </p>
    <p>
    Version control systems are used to give people, often in different locations, access to the same project. Similiar to Dropbox, version control systems digitally store projects and allow people to edit these projects from any computer.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Dropbox is the 'hub' where multiple people can access the same information, Git is your personal computer server. When you are ready to share those changes with the 'hub,' you can 'commit,' or save those changes, then 'push' those changes to the 'hub,' also known as GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the changes are pushed to GitHub, your larger network has access to your work. In a team environment, people can continously 'commit,'save, work to Git on their personal computer and then 'push,' share, that work with GitHub for collaborations.

      Adding, pushing and committing all happens in real-time, giving you the option to instantly share or access work in GitHub. As a result, multiple people can work of off the most up-to-date version of a project without disrupting eachother's work.
