    Like how the 'save' function saves work in Micrsoft Word, version control's function is to record changes and protect work. Taking it a step further, version control allows developers developers to take detailed snapshots of their projects and go back and review their progress.
    </p>
    <p>
    Version control systems are used to give people, often in different locations, access to the same project. Similiar to Dropbox, version control systems digitally store projects and allow people to edit these projects from any computer.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Dropbox is the 'hub' where multiple people can access the same information, Git keeps track of your project on your personal computer. When you are ready to share those changes with the 'hub,' you can 'commit,' or save those changes, then 'push' those changes to the 'hub,' also known as GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the changes are pushed to GitHub, you are able to share your work with your larger network. When working with a team, people can continously 'commit,' or save, work to Git on their personal computer and then 'push,' or share, that work with GitHub and share their collaborations. All of this happens in real-time, giving people instant access to work pushed to GitHub. As a result, all team members can work of off the most up-to-date version of a project without disrupting eachother's work.
