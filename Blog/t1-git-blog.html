    Like the 'save' function saves work in micrsoft word, version control is used to record changes and protect work. With version control, a developer can take detailed snapshots of their way, saving along the way, and go back and review their project's progress at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
    Version control also allows people in different locations access to access the same project. Like Dropbox, people working in remote locations can contribute to the same project in real-time.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Dropbox is the 'hub' where multiple people can access the same information, Git keeps track of your project on your personal computer. When you are ready to share those changes with the 'hub,' you can 'commit,' or save those changes, then 'push' those changes to the 'hub,' also known as GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the changes are pushed to GitHub, you are able to share your work with your larger network. So throughout the length of a project, team meembers can 'commit,' or save, work to Git on their personal computer and then 'push,' or share, that work with GitHub and share their collaborations.
