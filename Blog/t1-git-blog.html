    <h1>Version Control, Git & GitHub FAQs  </h1>

    <p>
      <span>Q:</span> What is Version Control (and why do we care)?
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>A:</span> kind of like how the 'save' function saves work in Microsoft Word, a Version Control System (VCS) records changes and protects work. Unlike Microsoft Word, version control doesn’t simply save work by replacing the older file with a new one; it takes detailed snapshots that record the timeline of your work.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>Q:</span> Why do developers use version control?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>A:</span> Version control acts like a time machine. It allows developers to regress to any version of their project. They can record their progress, research older work and share for collaboration.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>Q:</span>  What is Git?
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>A:</span> Git is the local version control system, meaning it lives on your computer. Kind of like how a USB drive lives in your desktop drawer, your work on Git stays on your local server until you decide to share it with the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>Q:</span> What is GitHub?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>A:</span> Going back to the last analogy, if Git is a USB drive then GitHub is Dropbox. It’s a community where developers can share their work and collaborate. GitHub also uses version control to track and save the progress of your projects.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Q:</span> How do developers share work on GitHub?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>A:</span> As you develop projects on your local server, or Git, you commit, or save, your work with version control. After your project is committed and up-to-date on your local server, you can share your project by pushing, or sharing, it to GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Q:</span> How does GitHub come in handy?
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>A:</span> The beauty of GitHub is that once changes are pushed to GitHub, your larger network has access to your work. In a team environment, people can continuously 'commit,' or save, their work to Git and then 'push,' or share, that work with GitHub for collaborations.

     All of this committing and pushing happens in real-time, giving developers the option to instantly share and access work in GitHub. As a result, multiple people, often in different locations, can work of off the most up-to-date version of a project without disrupting each other's work. Pretty handy!
