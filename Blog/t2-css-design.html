It's week-2 at Dev Bootcamp and we're diving head first into HTML and CSS. If you aren't familiar, HTML and CSS are source code that work in conjunction to develop and design websites. One is responsible for the nuts and bolts of a web site, HTML, and the other is used to style those nuts and bolts, CSS.
</p>
    <p>

I've had the pleasure of working with HTML prior to this week, but CSS was brannnnnnd new to me. While there was a lot to learn, I was able to find some good materials that offered some well-written, detailed explanations--shout out to Code Academy and Reddit University! This is an attempt to make a contribution of my own, one that focuses on ids and classes.
   </p>
<p>

Ids and classes can be easy to mix-up or misinterpret. In order to better understand their distinctions and clarify their best use, we're going to take a trip back to high school. Specifically, North Shore High from the movie <em>Mean Girls</em>.


    </p>

    <p>
Caty Heron isn't sure what to make of the student population when she first arrives at North Shore High. To fill her in, her classmate Janis whittles the student body down into different social circles and describes the characteristics they possess.
</p>

<p>
Similarly in CSS, one element, or student, may have the same characteristics, or style, as another student. A consolidated way to give these elements the same characteristics in HTML is to assign them a class in CSS.
</p>
<p>
Let’s say our elements are three different students, student's we’d classify as plastics. It looks like this in HTML:
    </p>
    <p>
    <img src="../imgs/plastics1.png">
  </p>
    <p>
Now that Regina, Gretchen and Karen are all classified as plastics in HTML, we use CSS to give the plastics universal characteristics. They're called styles:
    </p>
    <p>
    <img src="../imgs/plastics.png">
    </p>
    <p>
Notice the period before the element plastics. The period is what tells CSS that “plastics” is a class. CSS would not be able to distinguish word “plastics” as a class without the period.
    </p>
    <p>
A different, and more specific, type of identifier is an id. The id is used in situations where the element is extremely unique, so unique that there is nothing else like it in the entire HTML document. Kind of like in the movie <em>Mean Girls</em>, there is only one protagonist. If there were two Caty Heron's in the movie, it simply wouldn't work. Just like in HTML, only one id is allowed. To id the element protagonist in HTML we'd type the following...
    </p>
    <p>
    <img src="../imgs/protagonist.png">
    </p>
     <p>
...and then some addional typing in CSS to style the protagonist id Caty Heron.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
Notice the id name is prefaced by a #. Remember the period we use to preface a class? The # does the same job as the period; it tells CSS that Caty Heron is the id.
    </p>
    <p>

So there you have it, not too tricky once you take a closer look! Also wayyyy less complicated than high school. Cheers!
