  <h1>Learning Ruby:Distinguishing Hashes & Arrays</h1>

We're diving head first into Ruby this week and the methods, parameters, variables, etc. are raining down upon us. With so many objects to choose from--everything in Ruby is an object, FYI--it important to be able to distinguish all their special functions so one doesn't confuse the other.
  </p>
  <p>
  Two strikingly similiar objects are Hashes and Arrays. The two have are like eachother because they are both collections. A collection is kind of like a database in that it's a place in a program where one can store and retrieve data by looking it up or calling upon it. Still, while they're similar, the two have some distinguishing features.
</p>
    <p>
<h3>Hashes</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
    A good way to think of an array is like an ordered list, one that lives between two square brackets. Array lists are always indexed by numbers starting at 0. Say we have an Array of five elements, that list is elements 0-4. Those idexes are the default and they can be changed on command.

   </p>
   <h3>Hashes</h3>
    <p>
     A Hash is a bit different. While it's also a collection, each element of the collection is a key-value pair- one key and one value. Like arrays, Hashes are also indexed. The key is used to index the values, and each is assigned their index by the order they were entered into the hash.
