  <h1>Object-Oriented vs. functional programming</h1>

    <h4>Feb 19th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      While the programming world is full of nuances, programming languages shares some of the same overarching goals: to be readable and adaptable. In order to achieve those goals, one must determine which ‘type’ of language will produce the most appropriate project design and, therefore, works best for the evolution of their project. Two types of languages are the Object Oriented Language and the Functional Language.

      Object-Oriented Languages
    </p>
    <p>
      Object-Oriented languages are good for fixed sets of operations on things. If you’d like to expand on your program, you can add new ‘things’ or classes. This type of expansion allows preserves your early classes and operations.

    </p>
    <p>
      Functional Languages

    </p>
    <p>
      Functional Languages work well when you have a fixed set of things, not operations on things, just things. As your code evolves, you tend to add new operations on those things—classes will receive more methods. This preserves your existing “things” but allows them to perform differently.
