  <h1>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h1>

    <h4>February 27th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      Think about something you use everyday, like your car your cellphone or your hairbrush. What do they all have in common (besides the fact that you use them everyday). They all have properties. For example, your hairbrush has bristles, a color, a size and you use that item to brush your hair.

      Just like in real life, JavaScript and Ruby use elements that different characteristics can be assigned to. They do this by catching different values and holding them to one variable. In Ruby that variable is a hash, and in JavaScript that variable is an object. Let’s compare the two.

    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript Objects

    </p>
    <p>
      To create a JavaScript Object you will first create a variable. Say we’re creating the variable animal and that animal is a cat. We would write that as:  var animal = “cat”;

    </p>
    <p>
      We can also add additional characteristics like size, color and age by writing the following:  size: 7, color: blue, age: 50.  Those are called the properties of the JavaScript objects.

   </p>
    <p>
      Ruby Hashes slightly vary from JavaScript Objects. Hashes take a series of key-value pairs- we call the key to access the pair. If we were to create a hash called dog1 and add one dog named Fred to the hash, we would write the following: Dogs = {Dog1 => “Fred” } When we call the key Dog1 we will see the string “Fred” appear.

    </p>
      <p>
      We can add additional key-value pairs to the hash dogs by doing the following: Dogs = {Dog1 => “Fred”, Dog2 => “Joan”, Dog3 => “Michael Jackson”, }. Any time we call dog 1, 2, or 3 we will see the value of the key.

    </p>
