    <h1>Let’s talk about Rails</h1>

    <h4>March 6th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      Before I even got my feet wet with basic programming I heard the term Ruby on Rails thrown around regularly.  But even after enrolling in DBC and weeks of studying Ruby, Rails remained a mystery.  After doing a little research of my own, I was able to gain a basic understanding of Ruby on Rails and it’s relationship with other programming languages.

    <p>
      In a nutshell, Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. The framework packages design and patterns of the Ruby language enabling developers to accomplish more by writing less code. Developers can use Rails without having expert knowledge of Ruby.

    </p>
    <p>
      Rails software can also be defined as opinionated. It knows the ‘best’ way to do things and regularly nudges developers in the right direction by raising suggestions and errors. Developers who use Rails must mold to “The Rails Way” of doing things to have a productive experience with the software.

    </p>
    <p>
      Rails has two guiding principles:

    </p>
    <p>
      DRY (Don’t repeat yourself): Pieces of code should be succinct and have specific purposes. Every piece of code should count and it’s unnecessary, and distasteful, to write repetitive code.

    </p>
    <p>
      Convention Over Configuration: It’s the Rails Way of the highway. Rails has a default set of conventions that relieves much of developer configuration.

    </p>
