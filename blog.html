  <h1>Take Me to The Kitchen</h1>

      There are two areas of the restaurant: the dining room and the kitchen. The dining room is where people view the menu, make their order and prepare to experience their meal. They may complain to the waiter if their food is cold. They might fuss if they wait too long for the bill. It’s an enviroment for the consumer mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
       The kitchen, on the other hand, is a big mess. Everyone is moving quickly, focusing on their work. It’s more of a, “outta my way!” type of environment. Everyone is jumping in and getting started. Dev Bootcamp is the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to starting phase zero, my impression of DBC was that it seems like an intense, fast-paced environment. In addtion to programming knowledge, DBC  promotes vulnerable and open learning. To put it in simpler terms for my family and other “non-technical’ people, I like to use a construction metaphor.
    </p>
<p>
      “Pretend I’m taking a course to build a house in a very short amount of time,” I say. “Imagine learning all those skills very quickly; skills like how to reading blueprints, designing a sky light or using a nail gun. I'm setting out to acquire all those skills, in a short period of time, and then build my own house. That new house will be my resume."
   </p>
    <p>
      My expectations remain the same after seeing the video. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous, because I definitely am. Beyond feeling nervous, I think the strongest emotion is that I know what I’m in for: DBC will be fast-paced. I'll have to be vulnerable and expose my weaknesses, and a lot of my ignorance, to my cohort. Most importantly, it's me to get the work done and acquire the skills I need to build my dream house. I’m ready!

  <h1>Getting Aquainted with Git</h1>

    Like how the 'save' function saves work in Micrsoft Word, version control's function record changes to protect work. Version control also allows developers to take detailed snapshots of their projects so they may go back and review their progress.
    </p>

    <p>
    Version control systems are used to give people, often in different locations, access to the same project. Similiar to Dropbox, version control systems digitally store projects and allow people to edit these projects from any computer.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Dropbox is the 'hub' where multiple people can access the same information, Git is your personal computer server. When you are ready to share those changes with the 'hub,' you can 'commit,' or save those changes, then 'push' those changes to the 'hub,' also known as GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the changes are pushed to GitHub, your larger network has access to your work. In a team environment, people can continously 'commit,'save, work to Git on their personal computer and then 'push,' share, that work with GitHub for collaborations.

      Adding, pushing and committing all happens in real-time, giving you the option to instantly share or access work in GitHub. As a result, multiple people can work of off the most up-to-date version of a project without disrupting eachother's work.
    </p>
