  <h1>Mean Girls Guide to Classes and Ids</h1>

    <p>
Some of us remember high school as our glory days, others remember that time as the four years we existed within a confined social structure. No matter how you slice it, high school was a part of most of our lives. And further it’s perfect elements to use as a metaphor for classes and ids. Specifically, North Shore High in the Movie Mean Girls.
    </p>

    <p>
Like in the movie, Caty Heron’s introduction to North Shore High is distilled into descriptions of different social circles and the characteristics they possess. Similarly in css, one selector, or student, may have the same classifications as others. In order the make that relationship; we give the student a class. Let’s say we have some students that we’d classify as plastics, in html we’d write:
    </p>
    <p>
Regina George class=”plastic”/>
Gretchen Wieners class=”plastic”/>
Karen Smith class=”plastic”/>
    </p>
    <p>
After we classify the plastics in html, we use css, to give the class attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
.Plastics {
Superficial
Pink on Tuesdays
Write in Burn Book
}
    </p>
    <p>
Notice the period before the plastics, the selector. The period is what tells css that “plastics” is a class. CSS would not be able to distinguish word “plastic” as a class without the period.
    </p>
    <p>
A different, and more specific, type of identifier is an id.  The id is used in situations where the identifier is for an individual. This works perfectly for individual North Shore High students.  Similarly to html, you also signify the id in html. Maybe something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
<New girl class=”Caty Heron”/>
    </p>
    <p>
We have our new girl as the selector and Caty Heron as the id name. We then give the  id attributes in css.
     </p>
     <p>
We have our new girl as the selector and Caty Heron as the id name. We then give the  id attributes in css.
    </p>
    <p>
#Caty Heron {
Mathletes
Red hair
From Africa
Has a crush on Aaron Samuels
}
    </p>
    <p>
Notice the id name is prefixed by a #. The # tells css that Caty Heron is the id.
    </p>
    <p>
So there you have it, a mean girls guide to id’s and classes in html.  Not too tricky once you take a close look. Also wayyyy less complicated than high school. Cheers!
